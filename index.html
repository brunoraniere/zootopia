                Zootopia is a modern tale of anthropomorphic animals living in harmony in a specially designed city. The story revolves around Judy Hopps, a rabbit from rural Bunnyburrow who fulfills her childhood dream of becoming the first rabbit officer in the Zootopia Police Department. She soon learns how tough it is to enforce the law, and that her job gets even harder when she has to work with slick con-artist fox Nick Wilde to solve a major case. The film explores themes such as prejudice, stereotypes, and unity through its compelling narrative and memorable characters.
